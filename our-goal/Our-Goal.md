# :apple: :pineapple: What is Veggie coin all about? :banana: :strawberry:

Every year, 2.7 million dogs and cats are slaughtered at animal shelters, due to a lack of space to accommodate them, and a low number of adoptive homes.

In 2016, RSPCA euthanized almost 30% of cats in their care, and more than 42% of horses, livestock and other small animals.

### What's gone wrong?

Animal welfare charities are desperate for funding, with many relying solely on donations from the public. With little government funding, many animal welfare groups are struggling to look after their huge collection of animals.

## So that's where :grapes: VeggieCoin :melon: comes in!

VeggieCoin offers an exciting and innovative way to contribute to animal welfare groups and initiatives, without donating large amounts of conventional currency. Users running the Veggie software, will be contributing to the health and welfare of a number of amazing startups and charities, chosen by the Veggie community.

### :pig2: :cow2: How does a cryptocurrency help animals? :goat: :ox:

“Veggie Farmers“ who mine and trade VeggieCoin actively contribute to bettering the lives of animals all over the globe.

Every VeggieCoin block mined donates 25% of the block reward to a special **Veggie fund** which is then used, through voting in the community, to assist the wellbeing of animals on shelters and hopefully one day better the lives of all animals through product deals and organization cooperation.

### :earth_americas: Why use a cryptocurrency for this? :earth_asia:

:sunrise_over_mountains: **Transparency!** :sunrise_over_mountains:

Many traditional charities operate with a veil of obscurity over how their funds are distributed. They are notorious for expending a large percentage of their donations on fat salaries for executives. Veggie operates on a public ledger, so anyone can see exactly where the Veggie fund is used. The Veggie blockchain is fully transparent and completely public, so any deviant behaviour is obvious to the community

:video_camera: :page_with_curl: **Public Ledger!** :page_with_curl: :video_camera:

The Veggie blockchain provides complete transparency in all transactions. The community can see the flow of currency between all wallets. All transactions on the Veggie blockchain are immutable and highly secure. As the Veggie blockchain grows, the security of each transaction is strengthened.

:mega: :speech_balloon: **Community Power!** :speech_balloon: :mega:

In traditional charity models, it is easy for executives to obfuscate the distribution of funding within the organisation. A donator has virtually no power to decide how their donation is spent. The Veggie community has far more power and influence. Each member has a voice on how the funds are distributed.
